This directory just contains some of my previous attempts at porting the
original MATLAB scripts to python, as well as some random MATLAB files that were
used for testing at one point or another. I decided that my time was better
spent designing around the MATLAB code rather than trying to replace it.
Nonetheless, I've included the old code here on the off chance that it proves
marginally useful to someone.
